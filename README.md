Project Overview
This project aims to explore the use of machine learning for regression tasks.
The model is trained on the Boston Housing dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning for predicting house prices based on various features.

Boston Housing Price Prediction
This repository contains code for training a machine learning model to predict housing prices in Boston using the Boston Housing dataset.
The Boston Housing dataset is included in this repository (boston.xls). You can find more information about the Boston Housing Dataset on UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Evaluation
The script evaluates the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The results are printed to the console.
